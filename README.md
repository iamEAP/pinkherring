## Steps to get started
----

1. Set up your local machine with Node.js, Nightwatch, and Selenium Server. Some basic instructions can be found [here](http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted#installation).
2. Modify ```nightwatch.json``` however you see fit, the only key-value pair that must not be changed is ```launch_url```. This [link](http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted#settings-file) has more information on settings and configuration.
3. We recommend using [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) as the default browser driver, but it's completely up to you which browser(s) you want to run and write your tests against. It is okay to include more than one!
